I developed a real-time chat application using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend. MongoDB was used for data storage, and Socket.IO enabled real-time communication between clients. The user interface was built with reusable React components and handled user inputs through controlled forms. When users join a chat room, a WebSocket connection is established, allowing messages to be sent and received instantly without refreshing the page.

On the backend, Express routes handle API requests, while Socket.IO manages socket events like joining rooms, sending messages, and broadcasting them to other users. MongoDB stores user and message data, and I used Mongoose to define schemas and handle database operations. I implemented CORS to allow safe cross-origin requests and ensured validation of inputs on both client and server sides for security and reliability.

The app supports multiple chat rooms and displays messages in real-time as they arrive. I used `useEffect` and `useState` hooks in React to manage state and side effects, ensuring the chat view stays updated. The project also includes features like auto-scrolling chat windows, showing timestamps, and notifying users when someone joins or leaves a room.

This project gave me hands-on experience with full-stack development and helped me understand the core concepts of real-time applications. It combines frontend design, backend logic, database management, and real-time event handling into a single cohesive system.
